## Task and Goal of this Challenge

The goal of the challenge was to create a backend application solely for keeping track of a company's inventory. The user has to be able to perform basic [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations, which are:
- Create inventory items
- Edit Them
- Delete Them
- View a list of them

An additional feature also needed to be implemented, which is discussed in the next section
