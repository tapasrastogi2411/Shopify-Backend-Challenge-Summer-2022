## Task and Goal of this Challenge

The goal of the challenge was to create a backend application solely for keeping track of a company's inventory. The user has to be able to perform basic [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations, which are:
- Create inventory items
- Edit Them
- Delete Them
- View a list of them

An additional feature also needed to be implemented, which is discussed in the next section

## Features and functionalities completed
- This application has a fully functioning backend which is able to do all the required basic `CRUD` operations
- I have implemented a simple plain-vanilla front-end which the user can interact with to test/try out the `Create`, `Read`, and `Delete` functionalities. Though the `update` feature is not present on the front-end to view/test, IT IS FULLY FUNCTIONING ON THE BACKEND, which is the requirement

## Additional feature
The `additional feature` I chose to implement is the `Push a button export product data to a CSV` feature, which allows the user to export all the data/items currently in the inventory/database into a CSV file. This can be tried/tested either through clicking a link on the frontend or through Postman
